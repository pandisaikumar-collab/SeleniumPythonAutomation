"""
Networking Concepts
"""
Router: Connects different networks 
Hub: Broadcasts data to all ports 
Switch: Sends data only to intended device 

VLAN/TRUNK PORT/ACCESS PORT:
============================
VLAN: Virtual Lan: isolates broadcast domains 
Trunk Port: Carries multiple VLAN 
Access Port: Carries triffic for one VLAN 

Dynamic Routing Protocols:
==========================
OSPF: Link-state protocol --> useds Dijkstra's algorithm 
RIP: Distance-vector protocol: maxhop count 15 

Spanning Tree Protocol (STP):
=============================
Prevent loops in layer 2 networks.

ICMP/HTTP/HTTPS:
================
ICMP: used by ping/traceroute 
HTTP: Unsecured protocol 
HTTS: Secured HTTP using SSL/TLS 

TCP 3-WAY HANDSHAKE:
====================
SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK (Establishesh reliable connection)
