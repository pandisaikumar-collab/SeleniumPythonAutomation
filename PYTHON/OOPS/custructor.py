Constructor: 

1) Constructor is a special kind of method which is used to initialize 
   the non-static variables of a class at the time of creation of the object 

Properties of a constructor: 
============================
1. constructors are used to initialize NSV's of a class during object creation only 
2. constructor executed automatically whenever object is created.
   but normal methods we need to call using object.
3. for one more object, construcotr will be executed only once, becon only once we initlize
4. constructor should always be defined with the same __init__()

syntax: def __init__(self, paramters):
            .........
            .........

# Difference between Methods and constructors:

Methods: 
========
1. method name can by any name 
2. methoes are used represent the business logics to preform the operations 
3. method will be execute whenever we make a method call using object
4. with respective to one object one method can be called for 'n' no of times 

Constructors:
=============
1) constructor name should be __init__()
2) constructor are used to initilize the non-static variables of a class 
3) constructor will be executed automatically whenever we create a object 
4) with respect to one object, a constructor will be executed only once. 

Constructor types: 
==================
i) default constructor: A construtor without paramters 
ii) paramterezed constructor: A constructor with paramters.
