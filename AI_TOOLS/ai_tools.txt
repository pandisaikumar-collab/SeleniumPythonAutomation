How AI tools (chatgpt/ms copilot/VScode copilot)
Help in Automation/Manual takes
"""

1) underutilised to identify and fix syntax error quickly while working on with selenium based UI test scripts.
2) got help from Copilot to auto-complete repetitive locator handling logics in Locator yaml/Lib files
3) asked chatgpt to simplify complex logic used in network device onboarding and CLI validation workflows.
4) used Copilot to auto-generate reusable utility functions
5) leveraged AI to convert log python if-else conditions into cleaner dictionary-based logic for eaier maintenance.
6) used to clarify exceptions and traceback errors, saving time during debugging of flaky tests. 
7) creating YAML test structure examples 
8) leveraged AI tools quickly understand existing logics.



flaky test: 
===========
1) sometimes testcase passes and sometimes fails without any changes to the code 
   ,environment, or test inputs, these test are unreliable because their outcome is inconsistent.

    Timing issue (test tries to click an element before it's visible or loaded)
    Unstable Network (test depends on a backend service that responds slowly or inconsistently)
    Improper Wait conditions in automation (using time.sleep(2) instead of proper WebDriverWait)
    Dynamic content (element xpaths or data that change on every run.)
